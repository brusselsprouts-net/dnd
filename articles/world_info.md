# Ter Merivis

Once, in an era now unknown, a great empire of wonders sprawled the world, but its glory is now lost, erased by an age of chaos that reshaped reality, leaving only half remembered echoes and mysterious ruins to mark the great achievements of the past. History has forgotten the time that chaos ravaged the world, all that is known is that its salvation came with the arrival of the Gods. Now, over a thousand years since, the world of Ter Merivis is still filled with mystery and wild magic from those lost ages, and as its people reclaim their world it is up to them to discover what remains.
