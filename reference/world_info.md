# World

The adventure takes place near the town of Neverwinter on the Sword Coast.
The Sword Cost is an expansive landmass which, despite efforts of civilization, is still largely ruled by the wilderness.
Roaming bandits, wild creatures, and monsters have made travel between the independent cities a risky business.
The larger cities sitting along the Sword Coast, recognising this risk have formed "the Pact", an agreement to protect the main trade route known as the Coast Way. This agreement has long kept trade through the continent possible, but all who wish to venture deeper into the continent and away from the well worn path of the Coast way still do so at their own risk.

Travelers who brave the wilds of the Sword Coast may come upon ruins which whisper of the rich history of the region, now buried beneath old soil and years of conflict. With rich history come great legends, which in turn attract adventure seekers like moths to a flame. A great many tales of buried treasure, lost cities, and powerful magic permeate the Sword Coast, and among these few hold as much promise and danger as the legend of the Forge of Spells.


> If you want to connect your character to anything outside the region mapped here, we don't need to stick to the existing Sword Coast lore.
> In case the setting lives past just this campaign, I plan to change it around anyway so we might as well start making things up now.
