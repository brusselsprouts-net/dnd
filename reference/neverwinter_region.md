# Neverwinter and Phandalin

On the easternmost coast of Farmore lies the harsh but prosperous city of Neverwinter.
Farmore is an expansive landmass which, despite efforts of civilization, is still largely ruled by the wilderness.
Roaming bandits, wild creatures, and monsters have made travel between the independent cities a risky business.
Recognising this risk, the larger cities sitting along the Far Coast, among which stands Neverwinter, have formed "the Pact", an agreement to protect the main trade route known as the Coast Way. This agreement has long kept trade through the continent possible, but all who wish to venture deeper into the continent and away from the well worn path of the Coast way still do so at their own risk.

Travelers who brave the wilds of the Farmore may come upon ruins which whisper of the rich history of the region, now buried beneath old soil and years of conflict. With rich history come great legends, which in turn attract adventure seekers like moths to a flame. A great many tales of buried treasure, lost cities, and powerful magic permeate the Far Coast, and among these few hold as much promise and danger as the legend of the Forge of Spells.
