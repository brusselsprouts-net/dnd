# Homebrew Rules


#### Bonus Action Healing Potion
You can drink any healing potion as either an action or as a bonus action. When using a bonus action, you roll for the healing result like normal. If you instead drink the potion as an action, you receive the maximum healing that potion can give.

#### Sheathing and Unsheathing as Free Action
You can sheathe and unsheathe weapons as many times as you want per turn. Let the offhand attacks go wild. (does not apply to shields)

#### Inspiration Post Roll
You can use inspiration to reroll a d20 result after you have already rolled it once, but before you know the result of the roll.

### Exhaustion
This section is about a bunch of rules that change how exhaustion works because it is a bit of an overlooked mechanic.
#### Simplified Exhaustion
For each level of exhaustion you suffer a -1 penalty to checks, saving throws, attacks, and spell save DC. If you reach 11 levels of exhaustion, you die.

#### Close Call
If you go unconscious due to dropping to 0 hitpoints, you gain a level of exhaustion.

#### Comfortable Rest
Normally a long rest removes 1 level of exhaustion. If you take a *comfortable* long rest, for example in an inn, you lose 2 levels of exhaustion.

#### Extra Effort
You can exert yourself beyond your normal limits and the cost of gaining exhaustion. If you are out of uses for a class feature (fighter's action surge, monk's ki points, druid wildshape, sorcerer sorcery points, etc.) you can gain 1 point of exhaustion to restore 1 charge of the feature. For spellcasters, you can regain a spellslot by gaining 1 point of exhaustion per level of the spellslot.

### Spell Scrolls
It is possible to use a spell scroll even if it is not on your spell list, or if you cannot normally cast spells, though it will be more difficult. How you attempt to cast the spell depends on whether it is in your class's spell list and whether it is of a level you can normally cast.

##### Spell in Spell List and of a level you can cast
No check required, you can use the spell scroll freely.

##### Spell in Spell List but higher level than you can cast
You make a spellcasting ability check with DC 10+(spell level). On a success you cast the spell, on a failure the scroll disappears with no effect.

##### Spell not in Spell List
You make an arcana check with DC 10+(spell level). On a success you cast the spell, on a failure the scroll disappears with no effect.

|Spell Level|Rarity|Save DC|Attack Bonus|
|---|---|---|---|
|Cantrip|Common|13|+5|
|1st|Common|13|+5|
|2nd|Uncommon|13|+5|
|3rd|Uncommon|15|+7|
|4th|Rare|15|+7|
|5th|Rare|17|+9|
|6th|Very rare|17|+9|
|7th|Very rare|18|+10|
|8th|Very rare|18|+10|
|9th|Legendary|19|+11

#### Copying Spells from Scrolls
Wizards can still only copy spells into their spell book that are on the wizard spell list. When copying from a spell scroll they must succeed on a DC 10+(spell level) arcana check. Regardless of the result the scroll is destroyed in the process.
