# Exhaustion
This section is about a bunch of rules that change how exhaustion works because it is a bit of an overlooked mechanic.
#### Simplified Exhaustion
For each level of exhaustion you suffer a -1 penalty to checks, saving throws, attacks, and spell save DC. If you reach 11 levels of exhaustion, you die.

#### Close Call
If you go unconscious due to dropping to 0 hitpoints, you gain a level of exhaustion.

#### Comfortable Rest
Normally a long rest removes 1 level of exhaustion. If you take a *comfortable* long rest, for example in an inn, you can lose 2 levels of exhaustion.

#### Extra Effort
You can exert yourself beyond your normal limits and the cost of gaining exhaustion. If you are out of uses for a class feature (fighter's action surge, monk's ki points, druid wildshape, sorcerer sorcery points, etc), you can gain 1 point of exhaustion to restore 1 charge of the feature. For spellcasters, you can regain a spellslot by gaining 1 point of exhaustion per level of the spellslot.
