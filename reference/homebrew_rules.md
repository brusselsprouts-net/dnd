# Homebrew Rules

#### Bonus Action Healing Potion
You can drink any healing potion as either an action or as a bonus action. When using a bonus action, you roll for the healing result like normal. If you instead drink the potion as an action, you receive the maximum healing that potion can give.

#### Sheathing and Unsheathing as Free Action
You can sheathe and unsheathe weapons as many times as you want per turn. Let the offhand attacks go wild. (does not apply to shields)

#### Inspiration Post Roll
You can use inspiration to reroll a d20 result after you have already rolled it once, but before you know whether the roll succeeds.

#### Assist Without Proficiency
Normally you can only assist someone to give them advantage on a skill check if you have proficiency in that skill.
We will make it so that you can also use a different skill proficiency to assist the check, as long as you can reasonably explain how you use that skill to help.

### Exhaustion
This section is about a bunch of rules that change how exhaustion works because it is a bit of an overlooked mechanic.
#### Simplified Exhaustion
For each level of exhaustion you suffer a -1 penalty to checks, saving throws, attacks, and spell save DC. If you reach 11 levels of exhaustion, you die.

#### Close Call
If you go unconscious due to dropping to 0 hitpoints, you gain a level of exhaustion.

#### Comfortable Rest
Normally a long rest removes 1 level of exhaustion. If you take a *comfortable* long rest, for example in an inn, you lose 2 levels of exhaustion.

#### Extra Effort
You can exert yourself beyond your normal limits and the cost of gaining exhaustion. If you are out of uses for a class feature (fighter's action surge, monk's ki points, druid wildshape, sorcerer sorcery points, etc.) you can gain 1 point of exhaustion to restore 1 charge of the feature. For spellcasters, you can regain a spellslot by gaining 1 point of exhaustion per level of the spellslot.
