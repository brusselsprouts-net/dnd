# Calendar

The calendar of this world is defined by the lunar period of its larger moon Telak. A cycle of Telak lasts 30 days, which happens to line up with the 360 day years.

Three seasons control the global climate of Ter Merivis, these being the seasons of Bloom, Harvest, and Frost. The cycles of Telak divide each season into four "months", which are aptly named crescents.

The year starts with the First Bloom Crescent, and ends with the Fourth Frost Crescent.
