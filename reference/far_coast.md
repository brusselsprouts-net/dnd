# Farmore
Central Farmore is mostly uninhabited - the dangerous nature of the land here discourages most settlers. Some small villages do still spot the landscape, their residents either enterprising enough to make their living selling supplies and shelter to caravans between Itagate and Millramith, adventuring enough to keep exploring Farmore, or simply having nowhere else to go.

Southern Farmore is more populated compared to the North, the climate here making life more tolerable. Smaller towns are sandwiched between the coast and mountains, with some offering docks and supplies to passing ships.

# Far Coast
The western coast of Farmore, normally refered to as the Far Coast, is most notably host to the three port cities of Neverwinter, Itagate, and Liambek (ordered from northernmost to southernmost). There is no central government that successfully lays claim over Farmore, and so the coastal cities operate as city states, each independently ruling over their surrounding area. To impose some safety over travel along the Far Coast, the leaders of the three cities have formed the Lords' Alliance, a pact of mutual protection and maintenance over the Coast way. Since Farmore does not belong to any one nation, it is one the most diverse places in the archiepellago. It is not hard to run into a merchant, artisan, or exile of every species and nation during a single day in any of the larger cities.

Neverwinter and Liambek both steward a multitude of mining operations and towns in their respective areas, the spoils of which are shipped either over sea or, for those that cannot afford such transport, over the Coast Way into Itagate. Itagate in turn lies on one end of a large caravan path which stretches across the width of Farmore at it's thinnest point to the city of Millramith which sits at the deepest point of the gulf on eastern Farmore. From here, goods can be shipped on the much lighter (and cheaper) vessels that are able to navigate the calmer inland sea.
